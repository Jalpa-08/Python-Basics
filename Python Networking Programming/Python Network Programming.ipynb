These sockets (endpoints) can communicate within a process, between processes on the same machine, or between the processes on the different machines. Sockets use different protocols for determining the connection type for port-to-port communication between clients and servers."

    "What is Socket Programming?\n",
    "Socket programming is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other. One socket(node) listens on a particular port at an IP, while the other socket reaches out to the other to form a connection. The server forms the listener socket while the client reaches out to the server. They are the real backbones behind web browsing. In simpler terms, there is a server and a client. We can use the socket module for socket programming. \n",
